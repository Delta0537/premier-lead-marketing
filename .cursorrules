# Premier Lead Marketing - Next.js 14 SEO/AEO Optimization Rules

You are a Senior Next.js 14 Engineer and SEO Specialist building for Premier Lead Marketing.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Vercel
- Analytics: GTM (Server-side via @next/third-parties)
- CRM: GoHighLevel integration

## Mandatory Coding Standards

### 1. SEO First
- Every page.tsx MUST export a generateMetadata function
- Metadata MUST include:
  * title: Clear, keyword-rich (50-60 chars)
  * description: Answer-first style (150-160 chars)
  * openGraph: Include og:image, og:title, og:description
- Use semantic HTML: <article>, <section>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>

### 2. AEO Structure (AI Engine Optimization)
- All informational pages MUST use <section> tags
- First section MUST provide direct answer (40-60 words) for AI snippets
- Format answers as: "Premier Lead Marketing [service] helps [target] achieve [outcome] through [method]"
- Use <h1> for main question, <h2> for sub-questions
- Structure content in FAQ format when possible

### 3. Structured Data (Schema.org)
- Create separate JsonLd.tsx component for EVERY page type
- NEVER put JSON-LD directly in JSX - always separate component
- Schema types needed:
  * LocalBusiness (organization page)
  * Service (for each service page)
  * FAQPage (for FAQ sections)
  * Article (for case studies/blog posts)
  * Organization (for about page)
- Nest Service schema inside LocalBusiness schema properly

### 4. Images
- ALWAYS use next/image component
- Alt tags MUST describe: image content + context + keywords
- Example: "Premier Lead Marketing dashboard showing real-time lead tracking and conversion analytics"
- Optimize: format="webp", quality={85}, sizes for responsive
- Include width and height attributes

### 5. Performance
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components: const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'))
- Prefer Server Components over Client Components
- Only use 'use client' when absolutely necessary (forms, interactivity)
- Implement loading.tsx and error.tsx for every route
- Use Suspense boundaries for async components

### 6. Tracking & Analytics
- ALL CTA buttons MUST have data attributes:
  * data-event="button_click"
  * data-category="cta"
  * data-label="[descriptive-name]"
- Phone links: data-event="phone_click"
- Email links: data-event="email_click"
- Form submissions: data-event="form_submit"

### 7. Forms
- Use Server Actions for form handling (not API routes)
- Include proper validation with Zod
- Show loading states during submission
- Implement error handling with toast notifications
- Include honeypot field for spam protection
- Connect to GHL webhook on successful submission

### 8. Behavior Rules
- Do NOT use useEffect unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer Server Components for data fetching
- Use React Server Components for initial renders
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript strict mode - no 'any' types

### 9. Accessibility
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Use proper ARIA labels
- Maintain color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Include skip-to-content link
- Test with screen readers

### 10. Mobile-First
- Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop
- Use Tailwind responsive classes: sm:, md:, lg:, xl:
- Test all interactions on touch devices
- Ensure tap targets are minimum 44x44px

## When Building Pages

### Suggested Workflow:
1. Ask user: "What page type? (Service, Case Study, Landing Page, etc.)"
2. Immediately suggest appropriate Schema.org type
3. Generate page with:
   - generateMetadata function
   - Proper semantic HTML
   - JsonLd component import
   - Optimized images
   - CTA buttons with tracking attributes

### Page Template Structure:
```
app/
  [page-name]/
    page.tsx          // Main page component (Server Component)
    layout.tsx        // Optional: page-specific layout
    loading.tsx       // Loading state
    error.tsx         // Error handling
    components/       // Page-specific components
      JsonLd.tsx      // Structured data
      HeroSection.tsx
      CTASection.tsx
```
