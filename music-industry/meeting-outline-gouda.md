## MEETING STRUCTURE (60-90 min)

### PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (20 min)
*Goal: Understand his world before pitching anything*

**Opening (Build Rapport):**
- "Tell me about your journey - how'd you get into production?"
- "What kind of sound are you known for? What do you WANT to be known for?"
- Let him talk. Take notes. Find emotional drivers.

**Current State Questions:**
1. "Where are you at right now with your music career?"
2. "What platforms are you on currently? Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, TikTok?"
3. "How are people finding your music right now?"
4. "What's working? What's frustrating you?"

**Visibility Deep-Dive:**
5. "When you say you need visibility - paint me a picture. What does success look like in 6 months? 12 months?"
6. "Are you trying to get more streams? More production clients? DJ bookings? All of it?"
7. "Who's your target audience? Age, location, vibe?"

**Label Situation:**
8. "Tell me about these label deals on the table. What are they offering?"
9. "What's making you hesitate? What would make you say yes?"
10. "What do you wish they were offering that they're not?"

*Listen for: frustration with labels taking %, not delivering visibility, feeling like he'd lose control*

### PHASE 2: EDUCATE & AGITATE (15 min)
*Goal: Position yourself as the expert, show you understand his world*

**The Music Industry Reality Check:**

"Here's what I see happening with a lot of independent artists and producers...

The labels promise visibility, but what do they actually DO?
- They have relationships, sure
- They might get you on a playlist... maybe
- But they take 20-50% of your revenue FOR LIFE on those tracks
- And you lose creative control

Meanwhile, the game has CHANGED. The artists winning right now aren't waiting for labels to give them permission. They're:
- Building direct fan relationships on social
- Using algorithms to their advantage
- Creating content that feeds the machine
- Converting followers into paying customers

**The dirty secret?** The visibility labels promise? It's just marketing. And you can own that marketing yourself - without giving up your masters or your percentage."

---

### PHASE 3: THE BRIDGE (10 min)
*Goal: Connect his problem to your solution*

"What if instead of signing over a percentage of your music forever, you invested in building YOUR OWN visibility machine?

Here's what I mean:

**What labels do (that you're paying for):**
- Playlist pitching
- Social media presence
- PR and press
- Fan engagement
- Converting listeners to buyers

**What we can build for you:**
- Automated fan funnels that capture every listener
- Content systems that feed TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
- Email/SMS lists YOU own (not the label)
- Booking inquiry systems
- Beat sale automation
- Spotify pre-save campaigns
- Retargeting ads to people who've heard your music

The difference? You OWN it. You control it. And when you blow up - and you will - YOU keep the money."

---

### PHASE 4: THE OFFER (15 min)
*Goal: Present flexible deal structures*

**Option A: Performance Partnership (Recommended for Cash-Tight Artists)**

"I believe in your talent. Here's what I'm willing to do:

- We build your complete marketing system
- Reduced upfront cost: $[X] setup (covers our hard costs)
- We take [10-15%] of the GROWTH we generate
  - Only on new revenue streams we directly create
  - Bookings that come through our funnels
  - Beat sales from our campaigns
  - NOT your existing income

This way, we only win when YOU win. I'm betting on you."

**Option B: Hybrid Model**

- Lower monthly retainer: $[500-1000]/month
- Plus small performance bonus: [5-8%] on attributed growth
- Includes: Full automation setup, content strategy, ad management

**Option C: Traditional (If He Has Budget)**

- Setup fee: $[2,500-5,000]
- Monthly management: $[1,000-2,500]
- You keep 100% of revenue
- Best ROI if you have cash flow

**Compare to Labels:**

| Factor | Label Deal | Premier Lead |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Revenue Share | 20-50% forever | 10-15% on growth only (or $0) |
| Contract Length | 3-7 years | Month-to-month |
| Creative Control | Limited | 100% yours |
| Own Your Marketing | No | Yes |
| Own Your Fan Data | No | Yes |
| Exit Strategy | Difficult | Easy |

### PHASE 5: HANDLE OBJECTIONS

**"I don't have the money right now"**
> "That's exactly why the performance partnership exists. I'm not asking you to risk money you don't have. I'm asking you to let me invest in your growth, and we share the upside. The only thing you're risking is the opportunity cost of NOT doing this."

**"Let me think about it"**
> "Absolutely. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the money, the approach, or something else? I want to make sure I've answered everything."

**"I'm still considering the labels"**
> "I respect that. Let me ask you this - what would the label need to offer for you to say yes today? ... Interesting. Now, what if you could get that visibility WITHOUT giving up your masters and 30% of your income? That's what I'm offering. The labels aren't going anywhere - but the momentum you'd build in the next 90 days with us? That's leverage for ANY negotiation."

**"Can you guarantee results?"**
> "I can guarantee the work, the systems, and the strategy. I can't guarantee Spotify's algorithm or that every track goes viral. But here's what I CAN tell you: everything we build, you own. Even if we part ways, you keep the funnels, the email list, the systems. That's an asset that appreciates. A label deal? That's a liability that takes from you."

**"I need to talk to my [manager/partner/etc.]"**
> "Smart move. What would they need to see to feel good about this? Let's make sure you have everything you need for that conversation."

---

### PHASE 6: CLOSE (10 min)

**Trial Close:**
"Based on everything we've talked about - does this feel like it could be the move for your career?"

**Assumptive Close:**
"So here's what I'm thinking for next steps. Let's start with the performance partnership since it gets you in the game without the financial risk. I can have the strategy mapped out by [date] and we can start building your visibility machine. Sound good?"

**Calendar Close:**
"I've got availability [day] to do a deep-dive session where we map out your entire funnel. That work for you?"

**Scarcity (if appropriate):**
"I'm being selective about who I take on for these partnership deals because I'm investing my time and resources. I've got room for 2 more artists this quarter. If this feels right to you, let's lock it in."

## KEY TALKING POINTS TO REMEMBER

1. **You're not selling marketing - you're selling independence**
2. **Labels are the old model - direct-to-fan is the future**
3. **He keeps his masters, his percentage, his control**
4. **We only win when he wins (performance model)**
5. **Everything we build, he OWNS**
6. **Compare: lifetime label deal vs. month-to-month partnership**
