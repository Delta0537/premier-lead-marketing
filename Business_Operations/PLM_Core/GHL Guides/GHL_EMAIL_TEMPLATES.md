## TEMPLATE 5: Proposal Follow-Up Day 3

**Template Name:** `PLM - Proposal Follow Up #1`  
**When to Send:** 3 days after proposal sent  
**Subject Line:** `Quick question about your proposal...`

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Just wanted to check in - did you get a chance to review the proposal I sent over?

I know you're busy, so if you haven't had time yet, no worries. I just want to make sure:

1. You received it (sometimes it goes to spam)
2. Everything makes sense
3. You don't have any questions

If something's unclear or you want to talk through it, I'm here.

What questions do you have?

## TEMPLATE 6: Proposal Follow-Up Day 7

**Template Name:** `PLM - Proposal Follow Up #2`  
**When to Send:** 7 days after proposal sent  
**Subject Line:** `Is this still a priority for you?`

```
{{contact.first_name}},

I haven't heard back from you, so I'm guessing one of three things:

1. ✅ You're interested but swamped (I get it)
2. ❓ You have questions but haven't had time to ask
3. ❌ It's not a priority right now (also totally fine)

Can you just let me know which one it is?

If it's #1 or #2, I'm here to help. If it's #3, I'll stop bothering you and we can reconnect in a few months.

Either way, I appreciate the honesty.

What's the situation?

**When to Send:** After 60+ days, NPS score 9-10  
**Subject Line:** `Quick favor? (Takes 60 seconds)`

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I have a quick favor to ask.

You know how important online reviews are (that's probably one reason you hired me!).

Would you mind taking 60 seconds to leave me a quick review on Google?

👉 Leave a review here: [Google review link]

Just a sentence or two about your experience working together would mean the world.

If you're not comfortable leaving a public review, would you mind sending me a quick testimonial I could use on my website? Just hit reply with a sentence or two.

Either way, I really appreciate you!

Thanks,
Andrew

## TEMPLATE 11: Client Check-In (Churn Prevention)

**Template Name:** `PLM - Client Check-In`  
**When to Send:** Monthly (non-report)  
**Subject Line:** `How are things going? 💬`

```
{{contact.first_name}},

Quick check-in (no report this time, just checking in).

How are things going?

• Are you happy with the results so far?
• Anything frustrating you?
• Anything you want me to focus on more?

Seriously, just hit reply and let me know. Even if it's "everything's great!" - I just want to make sure I'm serving you well.

Talk soon,

## TEMPLATE 12: Upsell/Additional Services

**Template Name:** `PLM - Service Upgrade Offer`  
**When to Send:** After 90+ days of good results  
**Subject Line:** `Idea: What if we doubled down? 🚀`

```
{{contact.first_name}},

You've been crushing it with the {{contact.package}} package.

I've been thinking - what if we took it to the next level?

Right now we're doing [current services]. Based on your results, I think adding [additional service] could really accelerate your growth.

Here's what I'm thinking:

📊 CURRENT RESULTS:
• {{metric}} leads per month
• {{metric}} website visitors
• {{metric}} phone calls

🚀 WITH UPGRADE:
• Potential for {{upgraded_metric}} leads per month
• {{upgraded_metric}} website visitors
• Advanced automation to convert more leads

This would mean upgrading to the {{next_package}} package (${{price_difference}} more per month), but based on your current ROI, this should pay for itself immediately.

Want to hop on a quick call to discuss?

Let me know!
